# Solution for DX Technical Assessment

## Question 2. Coding Best Practices

### Very important to follow the DRY - Do Not Repeat Yourself principles.
### Make the code as usable as possible.
### Set standards for the teams so they can collective work and effectively contribute back to the code base.
### Keep reminding ourselves to stay away from spaghetti and bad code patterns.
### Follow OOPs and avoid use of multiple conditional or switch statements.
### Comment the code properly
### File names must be all lowercase and may include underscores
### All new source files should for logical package patterns e.g. com.dx.selenium.utils. or com.dx.ui.components.
### Import only required dependencies

### Variable naming should be camel case and the name should be self explanatory
example:
```java
dnsConnectionIndex  // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.
referrerUrl
customerId          // "Id" unlikely to be misunderstood.
```
